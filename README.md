## Project Summary

The Tic-Tac-Toe AI project is a console-based game providing a fun and challenging experience for single players. The game, written in Java, comes with a unique AI opponent with dual difficulty settings. Key features of the project include:

1. **Versatile Player Modes**: Players can either compete against a friend in the Human vs Human mode or take on the built-in AI in the Human vs AI mode.

2. **Diverse Difficulty Levels**: For players seeking varying levels of challenge, the game offers two difficulty levels:
   - Easy: A beginner-friendly mode with an AI that randomly picks open cells.
   - Hard: A more challenging mode where the AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make its move, providing a significantly tougher competition.

3. **Classic Tic-Tac-Toe Gameplay**: The rules remain the same - align three of your markers (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal on the 3x3 grid to win.
